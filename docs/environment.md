# Environment

First, let's set define our environment so that we are all on the same page.

**You will be needing**
* Node.js version 6.\* (I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), the Node Version Manager, to install Node.js so that you can easily switch between multiple versions)
* Your web editor of choice, [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a great pick for front-end development
* A competent web browser e.g. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.se/chrome/browser/desktop/)
