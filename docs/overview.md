# Overview

In this workshop you will learn how to build a shopping cart application in
Vue.js. You will make every component from scratch but be provided with some styling and boilerplate for each step so that you can focus entirely on learning Vue.js 2.0.

**You will learn how to**
 * Build a web app from scratch with the Vue.js 2.0 framework
 * Use [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) to route to different parts of your app
 * Create a unidirectional flow with [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) to separate data and presentation
 * Communicate with a backend REST API using the [vue-resource](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource) request library

**Key to perfection**

During the rest of this workshop there will be several "**Key to perfection**" sections.
These are assignments with hints, related to real world issues, that you could do on your own
if you would like an additional challenge.
